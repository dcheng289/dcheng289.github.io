I am a motivated and ambitious robotics engineer with a passion for designing autonomous technologies that leave a lasting impact. I am currently finishing up my research-focused Master's in Robotics/AI at the University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab with focusing on machine learning and perception, advised by [Prof. Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/dr-vijay-kumar/). Prior to grad school, I spent 3 years at [OffWorld Inc.](https://www.offworld.ai/) as a Lead Robotics Software Engineer working closely with [CTO Dr. Alicia Kavelaars](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicia-kavelaars/) to design and deploy industrial robots for underground hard-rock mining, and I spent 2 years at [OnRobot A/S](https://onrobot.com/en) under the guidance of [Prof. Nicholas Wettels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-wettels-48aaa83/) developing end-effectors for manufacturing cobots.

Outside of work I am a passionate basketball player and fan (Go Warriors!), active snowboarder and surfer, and strong supporter of STEM education through my volunteer work with the [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/) and the [Philadelphia Robotics Coalition](https://roboticscoalition.org/).
