I am a motivated and ambitious robotics engineer with a passion for creating autonomous technologies that leave a lasting impact. I am currently finishing up my research-focused Master's in Robotics/AI at the University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab focusing on machine learning and perception, advised by [Prof. Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/dr-vijay-kumar/). Prior to grad school, I spent 3 years at [OffWorld Inc.](https://www.offworld.ai/) as a Lead Robotics Software Engineer working closely with [CTO Dr. Alicia Kavelaars](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicia-kavelaars/) to design and deploy industrial robots for underground hard-rock mining, and I spent 2 years at [OnRobot A/S](https://onrobot.com/en) under the guidance of [CTO Dr. Nicholas Wettels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-wettels-48aaa83/) developing end-effectors for manufacturing cobots.

Outside of work you'll find me playing and watching basketball (Go Warriors!), snowboarding in the winter and surfing in the summer, and volunteering with [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/) and the [Philadelphia Robotics Coalition](https://roboticscoalition.org/) to support STEM education in underserved schools.

You can reach me via my email (derekch AT seas.upenn.edu), and you can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derekwcheng/), [Github](https://github.com/dcheng289), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EP_omZQAAAAJ).
