title: Neural 3D Scene Reconstruction
description: My master's thesis (in-progress) investigates integrating multi-modal sensing (LiDAR, RGBD, thermal) with deep learning techniques for 3D scene reconstruction (Gaussian Splatting, Neural Radiance Fields) to better understand orchard tree branching factors. Stay tuned for more!
